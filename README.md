For this assignment I changed some of the divs to make them semantic.  And because of this I had to change some of the css code to make it work still.  I added alt attributes to the images for people who arent able to see the images so it will tell them what is supposed to be there.  I added a title that was more descriptive so it would be easier for browsers to know what is within.  There were a few things of code that didnt need to be there so I fixed it up and made it neater.
